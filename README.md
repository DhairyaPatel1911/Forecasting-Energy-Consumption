## Project Overview
This project forecasts energy consumption using machine learning. The primary goal is to develop an accurate model that can predict future energy usage based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains energy consumption records along with various features that can influence consumption. The dataset requires cleaning and preprocessing before modeling.

Source: Finland's transmission system operator
Number of Features: 5 variables
Number of Samples: 52965 observations

## Preprocessing
Steps involved in preprocessing:

Handling missing data
Feature engineering
Feature scaling
Train-test split

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to understand the data better, including visualizing trends in energy consumption and correlations with other features.

## Models Used
The following models were implemented:

1. Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is a linear model that includes an L2 regularization term to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. It is used to predict energy consumption based on historical data and other relevant features.
Key Advantages: Simple, interpretable, and effective for linear relationships.
Implementation: The Ridge regression model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, with hyperparameters tuned using cross-validation.

2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

ARIMA is a time series forecasting method that combines autoregressive (AR) models, differencing to achieve stationarity (I), and moving average (MA) models. This approach is suitable for univariate time series data with a trend or seasonality.
Key Advantages: Effective for short-term forecasting, especially for stationary time series data.
Implementation: ARIMA was applied to the energy consumption time series, with parameters p, d, and q optimized using grid search.

3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

ANN is a type of neural network composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. It can capture complex non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable, making it suitable for energy consumption forecasting.
Key Advantages: Capable of modeling non-linear patterns and complex relationships in data.
Implementation: A feedforward ANN was trained on the dataset, with various architectures and activation functions tested to optimize performance.

4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to learn from sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs. This makes it particularly effective for time series forecasting, where temporal dependencies are crucial.
Key Advantages: Excellent at capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
Implementation: An LSTM model was built to forecast energy consumption, with various configurations for the number of LSTM units, dropout, and learning rate tuning.
